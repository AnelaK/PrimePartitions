# PrimePartitions
Prime partitions program implemented in 5 different languages

This project's goal was to learn about the differences in coding in different languages and to get introduced to the functional programming. 
The program prompts for an input number and prints out the prime partitions of the number with unique primes. In some of the program implementations 
I used the Sieve of Erathosthenes algorithm to calculate a list of primes numbers, while in the others I did this recursively.
